              with full explanation and internal JVM flow.

/* 
1. File name and Class name
   Java is strict here: class name = file name (case-sensitive).
   If your class is named HelloWorld, your file must be HelloWorld.java.
   If names donâ€™t match, the compiler throws:
   Error: class HelloWorld is public, should be declared in a file named HelloWorld.java
   Best practice: Use PascalCase for class names.
*/
public class HelloWorld {

    /*
    2. The main Method
       This is the entry point of any Java application.
       public  â†’ Accessible from anywhere (JVM needs to access it from outside).
       static  â†’ Can be called without creating an object of the class.
       void    â†’ No return value.
       main    â†’ Special method recognized by JVM.
       String[] args â†’ Array to receive command-line arguments.
       ðŸ’¡ Changing this signature (like lowercase s in String) breaks execution.
    */
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        /*
        3a. System.out.println()
            Java-style printing. Adds a newline automatically.
            Example:
                System.out.println("Line 1");
                System.out.println("Line 2");
            Output:
                Line 1
                Line 2
        */
        System.out.println("Hello World! This is Sadan");

        /* 
        3b. System.out.print()
            Prints without adding a newline automatically.
            Example:
                System.out.print("Line 1");
                System.out.print("Line 2");
            Output:
                Line 1Line 2  (Observe no space unless added manually)
        */
        System.out.print("I am here to teach you JAVA!\n");

        /*
        3c. System.out.printf()
            Formatted printing (like C/C++ printf).
            Example:
                System.out.printf("My name is %s and I am working for the last %d years", "Sadan", 25);
            Output:
                My name is Sadan and I am working for the last 25 years
        */
        System.out.printf("Let's join hands and learn together...\n");
    }
}

/*
4. How it Runs Internally (Deep JVM Flow)
   1. Save file as HelloWorld.java
   2. Compile: javac HelloWorld.java  â†’ produces HelloWorld.class (bytecode)
   3. Run   : java HelloWorld         â†’ JVM loads class â†’ finds main() â†’ executes.
